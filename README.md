# The Otello showcase

This sandbox is loosely based on pieces of the offical documentation of OpenTelemetry [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/getting-started/). 

It specifically shows:

- An 101 on applied telemetry.
- How to set up Oracle OpenJDK, and run modern Java versions (17+) on it.
- How to perform Jave bytecode instrumentation for observability purposes.
- How to generate and examine logs from instrumented Java code.
- How to generate and examine traces from instrumented Java code.
- Hot to generate and examine metrics from instrumented Java code.
- Pattern Matching for switch, originally introduced as preview with [JEP 406](https://openjdk.org/jeps/406).

It is used as:
- A self-contained starter package for students and beginners.
- A demo kit for interactive meetups and conferences.
- A sandbox to work on and test modern Java features in relation to telemetry.
